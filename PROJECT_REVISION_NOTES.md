# Tale Dives — Project Revision Notes

**Last updated:** 2026-09-03, by a Claude Code session working autonomously overnight.
**Read this first if you are a Claude Code session picking this project back up** — this
file exists specifically so a *different* session (possibly on a different machine) can
resume without re-deriving context. It reflects the actual code on `master` as of commit
`087b413`, verified by direct inspection (grep/read), not by trusting the blueprint doc's
intentions — several blueprint sections describe features that are **not** built yet, and
that distinction matters below. **Check the Revision log at the bottom first** — it's the
fastest way to see what's changed since your last read of this file.

**Session summary, if you only read one paragraph:** every Tier 3 priority item shipped
and was verified live except #15 (Inspired Mode), which was spiked and deliberately
deferred with hard evidence (§4 below) rather than built blind — do not attempt it again
without re-reading that entry first. The verify-and-fix pass found and fixed one genuine
pre-existing bug (`stat_grant` was completely unimplemented) plus a defensive pool-clamp
and two small consistency fixes, but is not exhaustive — §5/§6 list concrete remaining
work. The beautification pass is barely started — §6 has a suggested approach. Nothing is
broken; everything shipped this session was verified live in a real browser, most of it
against a real Gemini turn, with any verification gaps stated explicitly rather than
implied.

## 0. How to resume

```bash
cd tale-dives   # this repo, wherever it's cloned on the current machine
npm install     # if node_modules isn't present
npm run dev     # Vite dev server, http://localhost:5173
```

- `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit`, should be clean before any commit.
- `npm run build` — `tsc --noEmit && vite build`, the real pre-commit gate.
- No test suite exists. Verification is manual: run the dev server, click through the
  actual flow in a browser. Don't claim a UI change works without having done this.
- A Gemini API key is required to actually play (Settings screen, gear icon on Title or
  Chronicle header). Without one, `sendAction` immediately no-ops with an error banner —
  this is expected, not a bug.
- Repo remote: `origin` → `https://github.com/kemave-arch/tale-dives.git`, branch
  `master`. All work this session was committed directly to `master` and pushed after
  each logical batch — there is no PR workflow in use here.

### A tooling trap that cost real time this session

The in-session browser-automation tool's `screenshot` action is occasionally stale by one
render frame — clicking a button and immediately screenshotting can show the *pre-click*
UI, looking exactly like the app is frozen/unresponsive. This happened here and briefly
looked like a serious regression (see commit `72f7ef9`'s development history). Before
concluding something is actually broken: re-screenshot after a short `wait`, or use
`read_page`/`get_page_text` to check real DOM state rather than trusting one screenshot.
A hard `preview_stop`/`preview_start` cycle plus a forced navigate also clears any stale
Vite HMR state if you're unsure the dev server is serving current source.

## 1. What Tale Dives is

A single-player, browser-only (no backend) AI-narrated text RPG. Vite + React 19 +
TypeScript + Tailwind v4. All state lives in `localStorage` via `src/lib/store.ts` — no
server, no accounts. The player narrates actions in free text; Google Gemini (currently
the only wired provider) returns structured JSON turns (narration + state deltas) per
`src/api/turnContract.ts`'s schema, applied client-side by `src/App.tsx`'s `sendAction`.
The full intended design lives in `Tale-Dives-Blueprint-v2_4.md` in the repo root — it is
a design document, not a status report. Treat every `§` reference below as "see that
section of the blueprint for the full spec," not "this is built."

## 2. Current file inventory (verified against actual `src/`, not assumed)

**Screens** (`src/screens/*.tsx`): `Title`, `Settings`, `MainMenu`, `WorldSetup`,
`NewGame`, `Chronicle` (main gameplay), `Codex` (Locations/NPCs/Factions/Lore/Quests/
Bestiary/Items browser + CRUD), `SlashCommandManager` (new this session).

**Lib** (`src/lib/*.ts`): `store.ts` (persistence), `jitContext.ts` (per-turn context
slicing), `shadowReferee.ts` (client-side validation of model-proposed deltas), `codex.ts`
+ `keywordLinks.ts` (`{{Term|category}}` auto-registration), `locations.ts`, `npcs.ts`,
`quests.ts`, `inventory.ts` (per-domain state appliers), `combat.ts` (Tactical combat
math), `leveling.ts` (milestone leveling + chapter boundaries), `bangCommands.ts` (`!`
client-side commands), `discovery.ts` (§5.12 Codex Discovery reveal checks), `crafting.ts`
+ `gameTime.ts` (§5.8 Crafting queue resolution + GameTime arithmetic), `summoning.ts`
(§5.3 Summoning/Minion engine), `factions.ts` (§5.4/§5.11 rivalry + derived standing),
`fsAccess.ts` (§6.4B File System Access API wrapper, new this session), `currency.ts`,
`derivedStats.ts`, `richText.tsx`, `slug.ts`, `autoRegister.ts`, `turnStates.ts`,
`backup.ts` (`downloadJSON`/`readJSONFile` plus the new `saveJSON`, folder-aware).

**API** (`src/api/`): `turnContract.ts` (system prompt + `TURN_SCHEMA`),
`providers/types.ts` (the `Provider` interface, new this session),
`providers/index.ts` (the provider registry — `getProvider`/`allProviders`, new this
session), `providers/gemini.ts` (the only real provider implementation — exports both the
raw `runTurn`/`runSummary` functions and the `GEMINI_PROVIDER` descriptor).

**Data** (`src/data/`): `classes.ts` (Preset Class Dictionary), `recipes.ts` (§5.8 Recipe
Dictionary).

**Ambient types** (`src/types/`): `fileSystemAccess.d.ts` — minimal File System Access API
types not yet in TS's bundled DOM lib, new this session.

## 3. What's actually built (chronological, oldest to newest)

Everything below is implemented and working as of `087b413`. See `git log --oneline` for
the literal commit sequence; the summary here groups by feature, not commit.

- **Core loop**: Title → Main Menu (Tales/Worlds/Protagonists libraries) → World Setup
  (Original Mode only) → New Game (protagonist creation) → Chronicle (the turn loop) →
  Codex. Gemini API wired end-to-end with structured-JSON turns.
- **§5.1 / §5.13 Tactical combat** — client-computed exchange math, no round-trip to
  Gemini for damage resolution once a fight is active.
- **§5.1a Milestone Leveling** — auto level-ups on quest completion / chapter boundaries.
- **§5.7 Player Defeat State** — soft-fail recovery (HP/currency penalty + a dedicated
  narrated recovery turn), not a hard game-over.
- **§2 Phase E Chapter Recap** — periodic summary + history-window flush so token cost
  stays bounded regardless of campaign length (the JIT context system in
  `jitContext.ts` is the other half of this).
- **{{Term\|category}} keyword links** — parsed out of narration, auto-register Codex
  stub entries, tappable in the Chronicle to open a popup card or jump to the Codex.
- **§6.4D Codex UI** — full browsable Codex across all 6 categories, with manual CRUD
  (§9) as a correction path for auto-logged entries.
- **§6.0 obsidian dark chrome redesign** — the current visual language: dark
  header/HUD/input glass with a gold (`#e8ca8a`) accent, turn-state theming, draggable
  block navigator, parchment-textured narration pane.
- **§6.6 Bang Commands** — `!npc`, `!items`, `!location`, `!faction`, `!quests`,
  `!bestiary`, `!recall`, all 0-token and entirely client-resolved
  (`src/lib/bangCommands.ts`), rendered as a "Roleplay Paused" dossier block in the
  Chronicle. Includes command-palette autocomplete (typing `!` opens a filtered dropdown).
- **§6.6 Slash Commands** (this session, commit `72f7ef9`) — player-authored saved
  prompts invoked as `/name`, sent through the *real* turn pipeline (unlike bang
  commands, these do cost tokens). Scoped per-campaign or Global (shared across every
  Tale) via a checkbox in the manager UI (`SlashCommandManager.tsx`, opened by the `/`
  button next to the Chronicle input). Each command carries a `pauseRoleplay` flag that
  forces that turn's state to `PAUSE` client-side (`App.tsx`'s `sendAction` takes a
  `forcePauseState` param for this). Autocomplete mirrors the bang-command dropdown.
- **Autocomplete dropdown opacity** — both the bang and slash dropdowns use
  `bg-[#141622]/60` + `backdrop-blur-sm` (60% opacity, per explicit user request this
  session).
- **§5.12 Codex Discovery ("Fog of Lore")** (this session, commit `fbdef88`) — every
  Codex entry can carry a `discovery` object (`src/types.ts`'s `Discovery` type: `state`
  known/hidden, `revealTrigger`, `revealCondition`, `teaser`). Reveal checks run
  client-side every turn (`src/lib/discovery.ts`'s `checkCodexReveals`, called from
  `App.tsx`'s `sendAction`) against `flag_add`/`loc_id`/`npc_mem_up`/`quest_update` —
  zero extra tokens, zero new turn-schema fields. A reveal surfaces an inline "Codex
  Updated" badge in the Chronicle log. Masking is enforced in both the Chronicle's
  tap-to-open popup card and the full Codex UI (grid cards + detail view show
  `???`/teaser/Lock treatment) — except inside CRUD Edit Mode, which always shows the
  full record plus an editable Discovery panel so a player can hand-author their own
  reveals. **Caveat**: there's still no seeding/grounding call that pre-populates hidden
  lore on its own — today an entry only becomes hidden via manual CRUD.
- **§5.1b Class Evolution** (this session, commit `3597869`) — the player's single class
  slot can change mid-campaign, replaced outright (non-retroactive: already-earned
  attribute points keep their history, only future level-ups follow the new class's
  weight vector). Two triggers: story-driven via an optional `class_evolution` field on
  `TurnResponse` (schema-constrained to the Preset Class Dictionary, so the model can
  never propose an unrecognized class — see `src/api/turnContract.ts`), or manual via a
  new "Character" Codex category (`src/screens/Codex.tsx`) with a class-picker edit mode.
  The Chronicle surfaces it as a banner reusing the Codex Discovery badge treatment (a
  synthetic divider block for the manual trigger, an inline pill for the story-driven
  one). **Scope note**: this works within the existing Preset Class Dictionary only — the
  blueprint describes evolution as reusing a "Class Grounding" search-grounded call for
  freely-typed class names, which doesn't exist at character creation either; that's
  bundled with Inspired Mode (Tier 3 item #15 below) as shared future work.
- **§5.8 Crafting & Resource Management** (this session, commit `ccec6d1`) — a
  timestamp-based crafting queue, fully client-resolved (0 tokens): a Recipe Dictionary
  (`src/data/recipes.ts`), queue/resolve logic (`src/lib/crafting.ts` +
  `src/lib/gameTime.ts` for arithmetic on the model's freeform time string), and a new
  "Workbenches & Recipes" Codex category with live-affordability recipe cards and a
  countdown on active jobs. A completion surfaces as a "Craft Ready" Chronicle badge, plus
  an optional one-line narration hook in the prompt when the player is at the crafting
  location on the exact turn it resolves. **Scope note**: station-location enforcement is
  skipped (no location-station-type data model exists — any recipe can be queued from
  anywhere), and "Resource Management" (perishable material decay, the other half of
  §5.8) is not built — it needs a static item-metadata dictionary that doesn't exist yet.
- **§5.3 Three-Branch Summoning & Minion Engine** (this session, commit `9a3158e`) — a
  class-gated, 0-token mechanic in the same architectural family as the read-only "!" bang
  commands: `!arise` (Dark Monarch), `!raise_skeleton` (Classic Necromancer, spends 1 Bone
  Dust + MP), `!summon` (Contract Gate Summoner, spends MP for an ongoing-upkeep
  familiar), plus a read-only `!minions` roster (added to `bangCommands.ts`'s existing
  switch). `src/lib/summoning.ts` holds the class-branch gating and per-turn MP-upkeep
  drain (a familiar dissipates, with a Chronicle notice, the instant its upkeep can't be
  paid). **Scope note**: Shadow Extraction's blueprint gate ("specific slain boss tags")
  is simplified to "any harvestable corpse" — there's no boss/elite threat-tier tagging
  mechanism in the Bestiary yet (every adversary auto-registers at 'standard' tier). MP
  costs/upkeep and minion `hpMax` are invented balance defaults, not blueprint-specified.
- **§5.4 Faction Reputation Rivalry + §5.11 Territory Standing** (this session, commit
  `52591e0`) — `FactionEntry.rivalId` (Codex CRUD dropdown) plus a new optional `fac_rep`
  turn-schema field the model can use to nudge a named faction's reputation; applying it
  (`src/lib/factions.ts`'s `applyFactionRepDeltas`) mirrors an inverse delta onto the
  rival, 0 extra tokens. A location's `standing` is now *derived* (not stored) whenever
  its `factionOwner` (now an id-based Codex dropdown, not free text) resolves to a real
  faction — recomputed everywhere it's read (JIT context, Codex UI, `!location`/`!recall`
  dossiers), and a Hostile-standing location's context slice gains one line steering the
  model toward STEALTH. **Scope note**: rivalry links are directional per-entry, not
  auto-mirrored — a symmetric rivalry needs both factions' `rivalId` set via CRUD.
- **Multi-provider abstraction + on-device folder saves** (blueprint §3.4/§6.4B, this
  session, commit `9a2fed0`) — a `Provider` interface (`src/api/providers/types.ts`) with
  a registry (`providers/index.ts`); `App.tsx`'s three Gemini call sites now route through
  `getProvider(apiSettings.provider)` instead of importing `gemini.ts` directly, and
  Settings' AI Model tab has a real Provider dropdown (previously hardcoded to `'gemini'`
  in the save handler). Separately, `src/lib/fsAccess.ts` wraps the File System Access API
  (feature-detected, Chrome/Edge desktop only) with IndexedDB handle persistence;
  `backup.ts`'s new `saveJSON()` writes into a linked On-Device Folder when one exists and
  is permitted, else falls back to the unchanged browser download; Settings' Backup tab
  has a Local Save status row (On-Device Folder / Browser Only) with a link/unlink button.
  **Scope note**: Gemini remains the only real provider — a second one needs a live API
  key this session doesn't have to build against and verify, so only the abstraction
  itself shipped (verified in active use). **Verification gap**: the native OS
  folder-picker dialog could not be exercised through browser automation
  (`showDirectoryPicker()` needs a user gesture / opens outside the page DOM) — the
  IndexedDB plumbing and feature detection were verified directly, but a human should
  click through the actual link/write/unlink flow before relying on it.

## 4. What's NOT built yet — the Tier 3 priority list

This is the standing priority order. Each item was independently verified against the
actual source (not the blueprint's aspirational text) immediately before writing this
doc — "not implemented" below means a real grep/read confirmed zero code, not an
assumption.

1. ~~**#10 Class Evolution**~~ (blueprint §5.1b) — **done**, commit `3597869` (within the
   Preset Class Dictionary only — see §3 above for the free-form "Class Grounding" scope
   note, folded into item #15 below).

2. ~~**#12 Crafting & Resource Management**~~ (blueprint §5.8) — **done** (crafting-queue
   half only), commit `ccec6d1`. See §3 above for the scope notes (no station-location
   enforcement, no perishable-material decay).

3. ~~**#13 Three-Branch Summoning & Minion Engine**~~ (blueprint §5.3) — **done**, commit
   `9a3158e`. See §3 above for the scope note (Shadow Extraction's "boss corpse" gate
   simplified to "any corpse," since Bestiary has no boss/elite tier tagging yet).

4. ~~**#14 Faction rivalry + Codex Discovery**~~ (blueprint §5.4/§5.11/§5.12) — **done, both
   halves**, commits `fbdef88` (Discovery) and `52591e0` (Rivalry + Territory Standing).
   See §3 above for scope notes on each.

5. **#15 Inspired Mode** (blueprint §Phase A.2) — adapting a real novel/series via
   title/author grounding (Gemini search-grounding tool + structured JSON output in the
   same call). **UI stub only**: `WorldSetup.tsx` renders it as a disabled "Coming soon"
   tab; `WorldData.mode` is hardcoded to `'original'` on every submit regardless of which
   tab is active. An in-code comment at `WorldSetup.tsx:13-17` already flags this as the
   reason it's stubbed.

   **Spiked this session (2026-09-03), deferred with evidence, not just risk-flagged.**
   Ran three raw test calls directly against this campaign's configured API key/model
   (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`) from the browser console, bypassing the app:
   1. Plain `generateContent`, no tools, no schema → **200 OK**.
   2. `generateContent` with `tools: [{ google_search: {} }]` (grounding), no schema →
      **429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED**.
   3. Same grounding tool *plus* `responseSchema`/`responseMimeType: application/json` →
      **429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED**, same message.

   Every grounding-tool request failed on quota while plain generation succeeded
   immediately after — Google Search grounding has its own, separately-metered quota on
   this API key's current plan (consistent with Gemini API free-tier behavior — grounded
   search typically needs a billing-enabled project for any real quota), independent of
   and much stricter than the regular generation quota this app already uses fine. This
   means **the core technical question — does Gemini actually accept `tools` +
   `responseSchema` together in one call — could not be answered**: the request never
   got far enough to be validated against that specific rule; it was quota-rejected
   before or regardless of that check. A 400 `INVALID_ARGUMENT` would have settled the
   question either way; a 429 settles nothing.

   **This is not a "try again later" transient limit** — it reproduced identically on
   three separate calls a few seconds apart, while plain generation worked between two of
   them, so it isn't a general per-minute cap on the key. Resuming this spike needs
   either the account's grounding quota to reset (may be daily, may need dashboard
   inspection at the `ai.dev/rate-limit` link the error itself points to) or billing
   enabled on the Google Cloud project backing this key. **Do not re-attempt this spike
   more than once or twice per session** — it's an API-quota question, not a code
   question, and hammering it doesn't get a different answer faster.
   If/when the spike succeeds: implement per the blueprint (§Phase A.2's grounded call,
   feeding into Class Grounding per §Phase B.2a's cross-reference — see Class Evolution's
   scope note in §3 above, which is *also* blocked on this same missing Class Grounding
   system), then wire `WorldSetup.tsx`'s Inspired Mode tab to it.

6. ~~**#16 Multi-provider support + on-device folder saves**~~ — **done, both halves**,
   commit `9a2fed0`. See §3 above for scope notes (Gemini is still the only real provider;
   the native folder-picker's live click/write/unlink flow needs a human verification
   pass — browser automation can't drive that native OS dialog).

### Also noted in the blueprint but not on the numbered list above

The blueprint's radial quick-action menu (§6.5) is referenced by both the Crafting and
general UI sections but doesn't appear to exist as a built component yet — worth
confirming/scoping if Crafting (#12) is picked up, since its UI hook depends on it.

## 5. Explicitly requested but not yet started (separate from the feature list)

Per the standing instruction this session was given:

- **Verify all existing functions/components and fix issues found.** Started this session
  (commits `f43488d`, `43d5ad8`, `087b413`) — not an exhaustive sweep, but real findings
  were fixed:
  - **Fixed** (user-reported, not found by internal review — commit `087b413`): narration
    (`nar`) sometimes rendered as one dense, unbroken wall of text despite the system
    prompt's rule 1b explicitly telling the model to paragraph it. Checked this session's
    actual saved turns directly: 2 of the last 6 had **zero** `\n` characters at all
    despite being 1300-2000 characters long, while the other 4 paragraphed normally — the
    model is inconsistent, not uniformly broken, so re-wording the prompt again wasn't
    going to be a reliable fix on its own. Added a client-side guarantee instead:
    `src/lib/richText.tsx`'s new `ensureParagraphBreaks`, wired into `renderNarrative`,
    which *only* acts when a turn has zero line breaks at all — any turn the model
    already formatted, even partially, is left untouched. It tokenizes into quoted
    (`'thought/dialogue'`) spans and plain narration first, so a break is never inserted
    *inside* a quote (which would break its `<em>` rendering) and a quote's attribution
    tag always stays with it; plain narration groups into ~3-sentence paragraphs.
    Verified against both actual zero-newline turns from this session's own saved data
    (1952 chars → 8 newlines/5 paragraphs; 1324 chars → 6 newlines/4 paragraphs) and
    confirmed live in the Chronicle — the exact turn the user pointed at now renders with
    clean paragraph spacing and properly isolated dialogue lines.
  - **Fixed**: `turn.stat_grant` (§5.1c permanent stat boosts) was fully defined in the
    schema and prompted to the model but never actually applied anywhere client-side — a
    real, silent gap predating this session. Now applied as a permanent attribute/pool-max
    increase in `App.tsx`'s `sendAction`. Scope note: only the Event/narrative source is
    covered — the Equipment source (item `stat_bonus`) has no equip system to hang off
    yet.
  - **Fixed**: added a defensive final clamp on `player.hp/mp/st` in the same function.
    This was prompted by live testing surfacing `mp: -2` on the test campaign (the
    earlier lead about a negative *ST* value was a misreading of the HUD — the actual
    stored/corrupted field was **MP**, not ST; verified via direct `localStorage`
    inspection, not the screenshot). Every individual mutation path (`applyTurn`,
    `applyLevelUps`, `applyMinionUpkeep`) was code-reviewed and clamps correctly in
    isolation, so the exact repro was never conclusively pinned down — the fix makes the
    [0, max] invariant hold regardless of which path produced a value, rather than
    depending on every current and future path composing correctly. Verified live: the
    corrupted test campaign's `mp` (-2) self-healed to 0 on the very next turn taken.
  - **Fixed**: quest auto-registration (from a bare `quest_update` with no prior
    `{{Term|quest}}` keyword link) showed a raw slug id as its display name
    (`find_the_lost_sigil`) instead of a title-cased fallback — `npc_mem_up` already had
    this right; `quests.ts` now shares the same helper (moved to `slug.ts`).
  - **Reviewed, no issues found**: `shadowReferee.ts` (`applyTurn`'s own clamping),
    `combat.ts` (attack/exhaustion math, disengage detection), `derivedStats.ts`,
    `leveling.ts` (aside from the areas above), `quests.ts`/`inventory.ts`/`npcs.ts`'s
    delta-application logic.
  - **Not yet covered**: a full live click-through of Codex CRUD for every category
    (Quests/Bestiary specifically — NPCs/Factions/Locations/Items/Character/Crafting were
    all exercised live while building other features this session and work correctly;
    Quests/Bestiary share the exact same generic CRUD code path so are lower-risk but
    untested directly), the defeat/recovery flow (`resolveDefeat`), and chapter recap
    (`recapChapter`) beyond the one instance observed firing correctly mid-session.
- **Final "beautification of the entire app" pass.** Lightly started alongside the verify
  pass (a JSX indentation cleanup in Settings.tsx) but not the full pass — see §6 below.

## 6. Suggested resumption order

1. ~~Pick up Tier 3 item #14's Codex Discovery half first~~ — **done** (commit `fbdef88`).
2. ~~#10 Class Evolution~~ — **done** (commit `3597869`).
3. ~~#12 Crafting & Resource Management~~ — **done** (crafting-queue half), commit `ccec6d1`.
4. ~~#13 Three-Branch Summoning & Minion Engine~~ — **done**, commit `9a3158e`.
5. ~~#14 Faction rivalry + Territory Standing~~ — **done**, commit `52591e0`.
6. ~~#16 Multi-provider + on-device saves~~ — **done, both halves**, commit `9a2fed0`.
   **Every Tier 3 list item except #15 (Inspired Mode) is now complete.**
7. #15 (Inspired Mode) is the last Tier 3 item — **spiked and deferred this session, not
   just risk-flagged.** The grounding+schema combination could not be tested: Google
   Search grounding is quota-blocked on this session's API key (429 on every
   grounding-tool call, while plain generation succeeds fine — see §4's #15 entry above
   for the full evidence). Before picking this up again: check whether the grounding
   quota has reset (the error links to `ai.dev/rate-limit`) or whether billing is now
   enabled on the backing project, run the same 3-call spike described in §4 (plain call,
   grounding-only call, grounding+schema call), and only build UI once call #3 returns
   something other than 429 — a 400 means the combination genuinely isn't supported and
   needs a different approach (e.g. two sequential calls instead of one); a 200 means it's
   clear to build.
8. The verify-and-fix pass is **started, not finished** — commits `f43488d`/`43d5ad8`
   fixed three real issues (see §5 above: an unimplemented `stat_grant`, a defensive
   HP/MP/ST clamp, quest auto-name casing). Remaining, concrete next steps for whoever
   continues it: live click-through of Quests/Bestiary Codex CRUD specifically (lower
   risk than most since they share the exact code path already exercised for other
   categories, but genuinely untested), the defeat/recovery flow, and chapter recap
   beyond the one instance already observed working. Don't assume more bugs exist without
   evidence — the pass so far found real issues by reading code and by noticing a live
   HUD anomaly, not by pattern-matching for problems that turned out not to exist (the
   session's own earlier "ST clamping" lead was itself a misreading of which pool was
   actually affected — see §5's correction).
9. Do the final beautification pass — **very lightly started** (one JSX cleanup in
   Settings.tsx, no visual/UX changes) but the real pass hasn't happened. This is a big,
   underspecified scope ("the entire app") — reasonable interpretation: a focused pass
   for concrete inconsistencies (spacing, copy, icon choices, empty-state messaging)
   across screens, not a redesign. Suggest starting from Title → Main Menu → Chronicle →
   Codex in that order (the order a new player actually encounters them) and noting
   anything that looks unfinished or inconsistent with the "illuminated manuscript"
   obsidian-dark chrome established everywhere else (blueprint §6.1).
10. Always run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` clean, and manually click through
   the actual change in the dev server (see §0's tooling-trap warning) before committing.
   Note: a `window.confirm()`/`window.alert()` dialog in a flow you're testing live may
   get silently auto-dismissed by the browser-automation tool — if a confirm-gated action
   appears to silently no-op, override it first (`window.confirm = () => true` via the
   JS-exec tool) before concluding the underlying handler is broken. This cost real
   verification time on the Class Evolution manual-trigger flow this session.

---

## Revision log

- **2026-09-03** — Initial version of this document, written after committing and pushing
  the Slash Command Manager feature (`72f7ef9`). Tier 3 list above is the starting point
  for all future work; nothing in §4 has been started yet.
- **2026-09-03** — Codex Discovery / "Fog of Lore" (blueprint §5.12) implemented and
  pushed (`fbdef88`). This closes the Codex Discovery half of what was originally Tier 3
  item #14 — that item is now faction-rivalry-only. Verified live in the dev server:
  created a hidden Lore entry via CRUD with a `flag`-trigger reveal condition, confirmed
  it renders as `???` + teaser + Lock badge in both the Codex grid and the Chronicle's
  tap-to-open popup, confirmed CRUD Edit Mode still shows the full record while hidden
  (masking exception per spec), and confirmed toggling the state back to Known correctly
  un-masks it everywhere. Did not verify the automatic in-turn reveal path (that would
  require spending a real Gemini API call) — that logic (`checkCodexReveals` in
  `src/lib/discovery.ts`) is straightforward, typechecked, and code-reviewed, but a
  future session should watch for it the first time a real flag/location/NPC/quest
  reveal fires during actual play, since it hasn't been observed live yet. `npm run
  typecheck` and `npm run build` both clean. Next up per §6: Tier 3 item #10 (Class
  Evolution), which can now reuse the `entry.discoveries` inline-badge pattern in
  `Chronicle.tsx`'s `TurnBlock` for its own reveal banner.
- **2026-09-03** — Class Evolution (blueprint §5.1b) implemented and pushed (`3597869`).
  Added `class_evolution` as an optional schema-constrained field on `TurnResponse` (enum
  of the Preset Class Dictionary — the model can never propose a class the client doesn't
  recognize), applied non-retroactively in `App.tsx`'s `sendAction` (this turn's own
  level-up, if any, still uses the old weight vector; only future level-ups follow the
  new class), plus a manual trigger via a new "Character" Codex category. The Chronicle
  banner reuses the Codex Discovery badge pattern as intended. Verified live end-to-end:
  opened the new Character category (showed real Warrior/Level 3/attrs/pools data),
  edited the class to Mage, confirmed the change persisted and the Chronicle log showed a
  "CLASS EVOLUTION — Now a MAGE" banner. **Tooling note for future sessions**: the first
  save attempt silently no-op'd because the browser-automation tool auto-dismisses native
  `window.confirm()` dialogs (returns false) — had to override `window.confirm = () =>
  true` via the JS-exec tool before the save handler's logic could be verified. This is a
  testing-environment quirk, not an app bug; §6 above now carries this as a standing note.
  Did not verify the story-driven (model-proposed) trigger path live, since that would
  need a real Gemini call narrating an undeniable, permanent role change — the manual
  trigger path exercises the same `evolveClass`-adjacent logic (weight vector re-pointing,
  banner rendering) so this is lower-risk than it sounds, but a future session should
  watch for it the first time a real campaign's story actually fires `class_evolution`.
  `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` both clean. Next up per §6: Tier 3 item #12
  (Crafting) or #13 (Summoning), either order — both are independent of everything shipped
  so far.
- **2026-09-03** — Crafting & Resource Management (blueprint §5.8, crafting-queue half)
  implemented and pushed (`ccec6d1`). Added `src/data/recipes.ts` (Recipe Dictionary),
  `src/lib/gameTime.ts` (arithmetic on the model's freeform time string) and
  `src/lib/crafting.ts` (queue/resolve logic), wired into `App.tsx`'s `sendAction` with a
  two-pass resolution (a read-only pre-turn peek for the narration hook, an authoritative
  post-turn pass using the turn's real resulting time for what actually persists), plus a
  new "Workbenches & Recipes" Codex category and a "Craft Ready" Chronicle badge. Verified
  live end-to-end, including a real Gemini turn: added Iron Ore via Codex CRUD, queued an
  Iron Dagger (ingredients deducted immediately, 1h timer shown), sent an actual turn that
  advanced game time past completion, and confirmed the dagger appeared in inventory with
  the "Craft Ready: Iron Dagger" badge on that turn's log entry, narrated context hook
  included (player happened to still be at the same location). `npm run typecheck` and
  `npm run build` both clean. Scope cuts (station-location enforcement, perishable decay)
  are documented in §3/§4 above — read those before assuming either exists.
  Next up per §6: Tier 3 item #13 (Summoning & Minion Engine).
- **2026-09-03** — Three-Branch Summoning & Minion Engine (blueprint §5.3) implemented and
  pushed (`9a3158e`). Added `src/lib/summoning.ts` (class-branch gating, the three
  `attemptSummon` outcomes, per-turn `applyMinionUpkeep`), extended `bangCommands.ts` with
  a read-only `!minions` roster, and intercepted `!arise`/`!raise_skeleton`/`!summon` in
  `App.tsx`'s `handleBangCommand` before the read-only path (these mutate real state —
  MP, inventory, corpses, minions — unlike every other bang command). `turn.corpse_add`
  now feeds a running `Campaign.corpses` pool every turn, consumed by `!arise`. Verified
  live end-to-end with a real Gemini turn: evolved the test character into Contract Gate
  Summoner (reusing this session's Class Evolution feature), ran `!summon` (MP 25→10, a
  "Planar Gate" dossier rendered with the new minion), confirmed `!minions` lists the
  roster, then took a real turn and confirmed MP drained 10→8 from the familiar's 2 MP/turn
  upkeep. Did not verify the `!arise`/`!raise_skeleton` paths live (would need a Dark
  Monarch/Necromancer test character and, for skeletons, Bone Dust in inventory) — the
  logic is symmetric to `!summon`'s already-verified path and code-reviewed, but a future
  session should spot-check those two specifically before assuming they're bug-free in
  practice. `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` both clean. Next up per §6: the
  remainder of Tier 3 item #14 (faction rivalry/standing derivation, §5.4/§5.11).
- **2026-09-03** — Faction Reputation Rivalry + Territory Standing (blueprint §5.4/§5.11)
  implemented and pushed (`52591e0`). This closes Tier 3 item #14 fully (both the Codex
  Discovery half from earlier and this rivalry/standing half) — **items #10, #12, #13,
  #14 are now all done**; only #15 (Inspired Mode) and #16 (multi-provider + on-device
  saves) remain. Added `src/lib/factions.ts` (`applyFactionRepDeltas`, `deriveStanding`,
  `effectiveStanding`, `repTierLabel`), a `fac_rep` turn-schema field, `FactionEntry.
  rivalId`, and changed `LocationEntry.factionOwner`'s Codex CRUD field from free text to
  an id-based dropdown so standing derivation can actually resolve it. Verified live:
  created two factions with a bidirectional rival link, assigned one as a location's
  owner (Codex UI showed a live derived-standing preview in place of the old manual
  Standing field), then dropped that faction's rep to -2 via CRUD and confirmed the
  location's standing automatically flipped from "neutral" to "hostile" with zero direct
  edits to the location — the core derivation-with-zero-extra-writes behavior §5.11 asks
  for. Took a real Gemini turn afterward with the new `fac_rep` schema field present;
  resolved normally, no errors, and the model spontaneously referenced "Shadow Guild" by
  name in its own narration (picked up from Known Entities context) — a good sign the
  data is actually reaching the model, though the automatic rivalry-mirror path itself
  (a model-driven `fac_rep` delta, as opposed to the manual CRUD edit tested) was not
  observed live this session — it's a simple, pure, typechecked function
  (`applyFactionRepDeltas`), same confidence level as the `!arise`/`!raise_skeleton` gap
  noted in Summoning's entry above. Also noticed and logged (not fixed) a possible ST
  clamping gap — see §5 above. `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` both clean. Next
  up per §6: Tier 3 item #15 (Inspired Mode) or #16 (multi-provider + on-device saves) —
  #16 is lower-risk and may be worth doing first if #15's grounding+schema spike doesn't
  pan out quickly.
- **2026-09-03** — Multi-provider abstraction + on-device folder saves (blueprint §3.4 /
  §6.4B) implemented and pushed (`9a2fed0`). **This clears Tier 3 item #16 — every item
  on the original list except #15 (Inspired Mode) is now done.** Added the `Provider`
  interface + registry (`src/api/providers/types.ts`, `providers/index.ts`), wrapped
  Gemini's existing `runTurn`/`runSummary` as `GEMINI_PROVIDER`, and rerouted `App.tsx`'s
  three call sites through `getProvider(apiSettings.provider)`; Settings' AI Model tab
  gained a real Provider dropdown (previously `provider: 'gemini'` was hardcoded in the
  save handler, dead field). Separately added `src/lib/fsAccess.ts` (File System Access
  API wrapper + IndexedDB handle persistence — needed a small ambient-types file,
  `src/types/fileSystemAccess.d.ts`, since TS's bundled DOM lib doesn't have this API
  yet) and `backup.ts`'s new `saveJSON()`, wired into all three existing Export/Backup
  call sites; Settings' Backup tab gained the Local Save status row from §6.4B. Verified:
  typecheck/build clean, the Provider/Model dropdowns render and persist correctly live,
  and — importantly — confirmed the fallback path is unbroken (feature detection and the
  IndexedDB get/set plumbing were exercised directly via the browser console and returned
  cleanly with nothing linked, meaning `saveJSON` correctly falls through to the
  unchanged `downloadJSON` path when no folder is linked, i.e. the common case for every
  user until they explicitly opt in). **Could not verify**: the actual native
  folder-picker dialog (`showDirectoryPicker()`) — clicking "Choose Folder" produced no
  visible dialog and no error, consistent with the picker either requiring a stricter
  user-activation gesture than an automated click provides, or opening as a native OS
  window outside anything the browser-automation tool can see or interact with. This is
  a testing-environment ceiling, not a diagnosed bug, but it means the link → write →
  unlink flow specifically has never been exercised end-to-end by anything other than
  code review. **If a human is available, the highest-value thing they could do for this
  project right now is spend two minutes clicking "Choose Folder" in Settings → Backup,
  picking a real folder, and confirming Export Active drops a file there** — that one
  manual check would close the last verification gap on this entire session's work.
  `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` both clean. Next up per §6: Tier 3 item #15
  (Inspired Mode), the last remaining item, or the verify-and-fix pass if a time-boxed
  spike on #15's grounding+schema combination doesn't pan out quickly.
- **2026-09-03** — Spiked Tier 3 item #15 (Inspired Mode) per the plan above, no code
  changed. Three raw test calls against this session's live API key (bypassing the app,
  run directly from the browser console): plain `generateContent` succeeded (200); adding
  `tools: [{ google_search: {} }]` failed (429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED); adding
  `responseSchema` on top of that also failed the same way. Google Search grounding is
  quota-blocked on this key independent of the regular generation quota (which is fine),
  and reproduced identically across calls seconds apart with a successful plain call in
  between — not a transient per-minute cap. **This means the core question — can Gemini
  accept `tools` + `responseSchema` in one call — is still unanswered**, since the
  request never reached that validation; a genuine 400 would have settled it either way.
  Deferring #15 with this evidence recorded (§4 above has the full detail and the
  re-spike procedure) rather than building UI/schema code around an unverified API
  capability, consistent with this session's standard for every other scope cut. **Every
  other Tier 3 list item is now done.** Pivoting to the explicitly-requested
  verify-and-fix pass next, since it needs no further Gemini API calls (mostly code
  review + local-state UI exercises) and the grounding-quota block doesn't affect it.
- **2026-09-03** — Verify-and-fix pass, first batch (commits `f43488d`, `43d5ad8`). Started
  by investigating the earlier-flagged "negative ST" lead directly against live
  `localStorage` state (not another screenshot read) — **correction: it was actually MP
  that was negative (`-2`), not ST** — the earlier lead misread which HUD column was
  affected. Traced the actual cause as far as code review allowed: every individual pool
  mutation (`applyTurn`'s clamp in `shadowReferee.ts`, `applyLevelUps` in `leveling.ts`,
  `applyMinionUpkeep` in `summoning.ts`) is correct in isolation, so the exact repro
  wasn't conclusively pinned down — spent real time on this before concluding a
  root-cause diagnosis wasn't going to be reachable through static review alone, and
  pivoted to a defensive fix instead of continuing to guess. While investigating, found
  and fixed a real, separate, unrelated bug: `turn.stat_grant` (§5.1c) has been fully
  defined in the schema and prompted to the model since before this session started, but
  nothing anywhere in the client ever read or applied it — a silent, complete no-op every
  time the model used it. Also fixed quest auto-registration's display-name casing
  (shared the existing NPC pattern via a new `titleCaseId` export in `slug.ts`) and a
  cosmetic JSX indentation issue in Settings.tsx. Verified live: the corrupted test
  campaign's `mp` (-2) self-healed to 0 on the very next turn after the defensive clamp
  shipped. `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` both clean after every change.
  **This is a first batch, not a completed pass** — §5/§6 above list concrete remaining
  work (Quests/Bestiary CRUD live click-through, defeat/recovery flow, chapter recap).
  Next up: continue the verify pass or move to the beautification pass — see §6's
  reasoning for why either order is defensible at this point.
- **2026-09-03** — Started the beautification pass (commit `5f271d1`), scoped to the
  newest UI added this session (Character/Crafting Codex categories, Local Save status)
  on the theory that older screens were already polished in earlier session batches (per
  `git log`: "Obsidian dark chrome redesign", "Tier 2 batch" commits, etc.) and are the
  lower-risk place to spend a bounded pass. Walked Title → Main Menu → Chronicle →
  Character → Workbenches & Recipes → Settings live in the browser. Found one real
  inconsistency: the Character screen's Attributes line showed raw fractional values
  (`STR 5.6`) next to whole-number pools (`HP 34 · MP 20 · ST 29`) on the same card,
  since STR/INT/AGI accumulate fractional amounts from level-up weight math while
  HP/MP/ST are always rounded — fixed for display-only consistency. Everything else
  reviewed (Chronicle badge stacking with multiple simultaneous badges, the Crafting
  recipe grid's live-affordability highlighting, the Settings Local Save status row)
  already read as clean and intentional — this app's existing visual language is
  genuinely solid, not neglected. **This is a light pass, not the full "entire app"
  scope the standing instruction asked for** — it covered the screens most likely to
  have rough edges (this session's own new work) but not, e.g., WorldSetup, NewGame, or
  a mobile-viewport pass. A future session picking this up should treat it as a
  continuation, not a restart — the newest UI has already had one honest look.
  `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` both clean.

  **Where this leaves the project, for whoever reads this next**: every Tier 3 priority
  item is done except Inspired Mode (deliberately deferred with evidence, not skipped
  out of neglect — see #15's entry in §4). The verify-and-fix and beautification passes
  are both genuinely started with real, verified work landed, but neither is complete,
  and this file says exactly where each one left off. There is no unstated or hidden
  work — if it isn't written down above, it either doesn't exist yet or wasn't checked.
- **2026-09-03** — User directly reported the narration-wall-of-text bug (pointed at a
  specific broken paragraph in the live Chronicle, saying it had come up before). Fixed
  and pushed as commit `087b413` — see §5 above for the full detail (root cause,
  client-side fix design, and verification against real saved turns from this session).
  This is exactly the kind of thing the "not yet covered" list in §5 exists to be
  replaced by — a live user report, verified end-to-end, not a guess. `npm run
  typecheck` and `npm run build` both clean.
